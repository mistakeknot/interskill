# Interskill

Skill authoring toolkit — unified skill creation, TDD-adapted testing, and audit.

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `create` | Unified skill creation workflow (spec phase + quality phase + TDD pressure testing) |
| `audit` | Skill verification — structure, frontmatter, invocation control, CSO compliance |

## Design

Consolidation of interdev's `create-agent-skills` (spec-focused) and `writing-skills` (TDD-focused) into a single skill with two phases: spec-driven creation followed by TDD-adapted pressure testing.
